*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
_You **can** combine them_

Blockquotes
As Kanye West said:
> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.


Inline code
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


GitHub Flavored Markdown


Syntax highlighting
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

SHA references
Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.

Issue references within a repository
Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.

Username @mentions
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”
